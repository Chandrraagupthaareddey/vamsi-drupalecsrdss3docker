# Deploy Drupal Containers on AWS ECS, RDS, S3

## Next Steps:
* Fix the manual configurations issues in `aws-ecs-immutable` branch to setup the ECS infra initially.
* Fix the manual configurations issues in `jenkins-deployment-aws-ecs` branch to setup the deployment using Jenkins.
* After fixing both the above branches, combine the logic of both `aws-ecs-immutable` and `jenkins-deployment-aws-ecs` in the master branch.
